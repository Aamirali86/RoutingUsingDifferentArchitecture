# RoutingWithDifferentArchitecture
Simple navigation for iOS using different architecture

## Reason
Because **classic App Navigation** introduces **tight coupling** between ViewControllers.
Complex Apps navigation can look like a **gigantic spider web**.

Besides the fact that **Navigation responsibility is split** among ViewControllers, modifying a ViewController can cascade recompiles and produce **slow compile times.**

## Benefits
- [x] Decouples ViewControllers  
- [x] Makes navigation Testable   
- [x] Faster compile times
